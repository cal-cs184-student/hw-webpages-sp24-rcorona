  </a>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
      <br />
      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
    When the ks constant is very high, the forces maintaining the structural constraints between pairs of springs is higher which causes them to bend and stretch much 
    less as the cloth falls over time. 
    If the ks constant is lower, then the forces from spring constraints is lower, causing the springs to stretch and bend more as the cloth falls. 
    In terms of final resting position, the magnitude of the spring forces will interact differently with gravity (whose magnitude is always the same). 
    Higher spring constants will cause the cloth to remain more rigid/taught against gravity, causing the cloth to sag much less. 
    In contrast, lower spring constants will cause the spring forces to lose out to gravity, causing the cloth to sag and bend much more. 
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Higher values of density entails higher mass for each point mass and therefore a greater acceleration from gravitational force being enacted on each point. 
      Therefore, higher values will result in both the cloth falling faster (proportional to the increase in mass) as well as will cause the final resting position of the 
      cloth to sag more since the amount of spring force needed to cancel out the gravitational force will higher (and therefore will require longer spring lengths in order
      to cancel out gravity). 
      Lower density values will cause a lower gravitational acceleration, causing the cloth to fall more slowly. 
      Additionally, the cloth will sag less at its final resting position since the spring force required to cancel it out (and therefore the spring length) will be lower. 
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
    A higher damping value means a higher loss of kinetic energy as the cloth moves. 
    In other words, this means that the velocity of the point masses at any given time step is heavily throttled. 
    Qualitatively, this results in the cloth falling more slowly given it's throttling of velocity. 
    Additionally, once the cloth falls to a point where the springs start to pull back on it, a higher damping value will result in a 
    a lower amount of oscillation as the cloth converges to its final resting position. 
    Conversely, a lower damping value will result in greater velocity values, causing the cloth to fall faster. 
    Once the cloth falls to a point where the springs start to pull back on it, the oscillations before it converges to its final resting spot 
      will not only last longer but will also have a higher magnitude. 
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
      For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters 
      and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

  <p>
  Here we see screenshots of the final resting position of <i>pinned2.json</i> with the default parameters, only varying <i>ks</i> in multiples of 10. 
  As we can see, as the spring constant magnitude increases, the structural forces maintaining the integrity of the cloth are increasingly stronger against 
  gravity, causing the cloth to sag less and less. 
  This trend is observed because each point mass will stop accelerating downwards as soon as the vertical forces from the springs it belongs to are equal in 
  value to the force from gravity. 
  As the spring constant increases, the length of the spring required to cancel out the gravitational force will be lower, causing the observed reduction in sag.

<p>
 Above we show screenshots of <i>pinned2.json</i> with default parameters with densities of 
15 g/cm^2, 30 g/cm^2, and 60 g/cm^2. 
  For each density we show two screenshots, at time step t=2 and t=4. 
  As we can see, the cloth will accelerate faster as the density is increased, causing it to achieve a lower vertical location 
  at the same steps in time. 
  This is because an increase in density denotes an increase in mass. 
  Therefore, the gravitational force will be higher causing point masses to accelerate faster. 
  Conversely, lower density values will cause the acceleration of the point masses to be lower, causing them to fall more slowly 
  in the same amount of time.

  <p>
  Here we can see images of <i>pinned2.json</i> with default parameters and <i>damping</i> varied in multiples of 2 from 0.0% to 0.8%. 
  The screenshots are taken from the side in order to show how the magnitude of oscillations are affected by varying damping.
  The screenshots are captured by stepping through the simulation and stopping as soon as the cloth appears to reach its highest maximum altitude
    after the first swing back around after falling to the bottom. 
  As damping is lowered, the cloth experiences greater velocities over time, which results in a higher maximum altitude reached as the cloth swings 
  back around the first time after reaching its lowest point. 
  This is observed because lower damping allows for the cloth to reach a higher maximum velocity once it reaches the bottom of its trajectory. 
    A higher maximum velocity results in the point masses stretching further down before the spring force begins to pull them back up vertically. 
    Because they end up reaching a lower point, the acceleration from the spring forces on the way back up will be higher, causing it to experience greater
    vertical velocity upwards which results in the higher maximum altitude observed.

      <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>

    <p>
    Here we can see how higher spring constants result in the cloth maintining a more rigid structure after it converges on 
    a final resting state on top of the sphere. 
    As mentioned above for part 2, a higher spring constant will result in a greater spring force. 
    This increase in spring force means that a shorter spring length is required to cancel out the force of gravity, resulting in a final 
      resting position that is more rigid and less saggy. 
    Conversely, lower values will result in lower spring force, requiring a longer spring length in order to cancel out the gravitational force. 
      This results in a final resting state that is less rigid and more saggy.

  <p><b><u>Spring constant:</u></b></p>

  Above we can see images of the cloth falling in on itself in <i>selfCollision.json</i> with values of <i>ks = 1,000</i>
  and <i>ks = 7,500</i>, using default parameters otherwise. 
  As we can observe, the cloth is much more rigid when the spring constant is higher, since it folds in on itself in larger twists rather 
  than many ripples as can be seen with the smaller value. 
  As observed in sections prior, a larger spring constant will make the cloth more rigid since the structural integrity of the spring system 
  will be better preserved. 
  The lowered proclivity towards bending will result in only having a small number of points where the cloth bends under gravity, since in general 
  the cloth will have a larger bias towards staying upright (even though it will eventually still fall flat).

    <p><b><u>Density:</u></b></p>

  Above we can see images of the cloth falling in on itself in <i>selfCollision.json</i> with values of <i>density = 1</i> and
  <i>density = 50</i>, with all other parameters taking on default values. 
  Observations are similar to when the spring constant is varied, however the relationship is inverted. 
  A higher value of density will lead to a more crumpled cloth, whereas a lower density will lead to a cloth
  which maintains its structural integrity much better. 

  <p>

    These examples show the inverted relationship between the spring constant and the density of the cloth.
    The higher the spring constant is proportionally to the density, the better the cloth will keep its structural integrity and vice versa. 
    Each bend in the cloth as it falls in on itself can be thought of as a point where the gravitational force won out to the spring force, and so the cloth
    must bend in one of two directions in order to satisfy the accelerations under structural constraints. 
    The stronger the gravitational force is proportionally to the spring force, the more points like this that there will be, which will result in 
    more ripples being observed in the cloth.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a program that is run in parallel for individual, independent units of a graphics pipeline (unit here being defined by the type of shader program being run) in
      order to parallelize the rendering process of a scene. 
      By running a shader program instance in parallel per unit, the efficiency of the rendering pipeline can be greatly increased. 
      Two types of shader programs are <b>vertex shaders</b> and <b>fragment shaders</b>. <br><br>
      
      <b><u>Vertex Shaders:</u></b>Vertex shaders are programs which operate over the vertices of primitives in a scene. 
      Their primary purpose is to (1) determine the screen coordinates of a given vertex during rasterization, and (2) 
      to compute certain vertex properties which may be useful for coloring fragments during fragment shader program execution (i.e. 
      to compute inputs to the fragment shader), such as the vertex normal and uv coordinates in world coordinates. 
      Vertex shaders can also modify the positions and normals of vertices in order to alter the geometry of the scene, as is done in displacement mapping. <br><br>

      <b><u>Fragment Shaders</u></b>: Fragment shaders operate over pixels to determine their color in the final rendered image. 
      For example, in the fragment shader, the input normal (which is determined by barycentric coordinate interpolation given vertex normals)
      at a given screen coordinate can be used to determine the illumination contribution 
      from lights in the scene as well as model their interactions with different material properties (e.g. specular, lambertian), as is done with Blinn-Phong shading.
      Fragment shaders can also be used to color objects in the scene by sampling from a provided texture, either directly by essentially mapping the texture
      to the object, or by simulating mirror <br><br>

      In summary, the two types of shaders work together by first having the vertex shader determine the final geometry of the scene (by potentially
      modifying the scene vertices), as well as determining the world and on-screen coordinates of a given vertex. 
      This information is then passed on to the fragment shader, which uses interpolated vertex information in order to determine the final 
      color of a given pixel in the scene. 
    </p>

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a formulation for simulating the illumination contributed by light hitting a surface. 
      It consists of four main components, the <b>emissive</b>, <b>diffuse</b>, <b>ambient</b>, and <b>specular</b> components. 
      Emissive light represents light being emitted by the surface itself, such as when the surface represents a light (the cloth in the simulator has no emissive component). 
      Diffuse light represents light that is scattered uniformly in all directions after hitting the surface, therefore the contribution of this component is independent of viewing direction.
      However, the intensity of the diffuse light is dependent on the direction of the light relative to the surface normal, and will be attenuated by the angle between the normal and
      the light direction based on Lambert's cosine law. 
      Ambient light is meant to simulate contributions from indirect or global lighting in the scene, since shaders cannot simulate the dynamics of light bouncing 
      around a scene as is done in ray tracing. Ambient light is not affected by viewing direction or by the direction of any light. 
      Specular light represents light that is reflected in reflective direction from the light source, and is meant to simulate how reflective a material is. 
      The exponent parameter in the specular light component formula can be used to tune the effective solid angle through which light is scattered around the reflective direction. 
      The intensity of the specular component is also affected by Lambert's Cosine Law, but instead of computing the angle between the surface normal and the light direction, the angle is 
      computed between the normal and the bisecting vector between the viewing direction and the light direction (this is done in part to avoid numerical issues with angles greater 
      than 90 degrees which would drive the specular component to 0 if computing the dot product between the reflectance direction and the viewing direction as is done in Phong shading).
