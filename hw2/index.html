<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>
<b>Casteljau's Algorithm Explanation:</b> Casteljau's algorithm is given a set of <i>n</i> vectors, known as <i>control points</i> and uses them to evaluate a degree-n <i>Bezier curve</i>.<br>
This curve is parameterized by a parameter <i>t</i> in [0,1], and the curve is the result of evaluating the Bezier curve at points within the range [0,1]. <br><br>
The algorithm can evaluate the location on the curve for a point t through n-1 recursive steps. At each level of the recursion, the algorithm is provided with a list of k intermediate control points (with the starting level being the original control points themselves). <br>
For each contiguos pair of points (p1, p2) a new intermediate point is computed as (1-t) * p1 + t * p2, and the set of all k-1 intermediate points resulting from interpolating each pair is passed down to the next level of recursion. <br>
The termination case of the recursion is when there is only one intermediate point provided, which will be precisely the point along the Bezier curve at coordinate t to be returned. 
</p><br>
<p>
<b>Implementation:</b> I implemented the algorithm recursively. At each recursion level I define an std::vector&ltVector2D&gt which will contain the intermediate points at the next recursion level. <br>
I then loop over pairs (points[i], points[i+1]) in a sliding window from i=0 to i=points.size() - 1. <br>
Each pair is interpolated into intermediate point p = (1-t) * p1 + t * p2, which is pushed onto the vector of intermediate points. <br>
At the termination of the loop, the vector of intermediate points is returned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Results:</b> Below I visualize results for the algorithm:

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
<b>Explanation:</b> The de Casteljau's algorithm does not fundamentally change when applied to Bezier surfaces, the same algorithm used to evaluate a point on a single line is instead used multiple times to produce a point on the surface. <br>
  Given (n * n) control points and a coordinate (u, v) to evaluate within the surface, the algorithm works as follows: <br>
  Without loss of generality, we first evaluate the coordinate u using the 1D de Casteljau algorithm on each of the n rows of control points, this will yield the point for u on each of the n Bezier curves defined by the rows. <br>
  Let's denote this set of n evaluated u points as p_u. <br>
  The set of points p_u itself now serve as a set of control points defining a Bezier curve, and evaluating this Bezier curve at coordinate v using the 1D de Casteljau algorithm will yield the final point with coordinate (u,v) on the Bezier surface.
</p>
  <br>
<p>
<b>Implementation:</b> <br>
<i>evaluate_step:</i> This method is identical to its 2D counterpart for Part 1, which is described above. The only difference is that the operations are all now on Vector3D objects instead of Vector2D. 
  <br>
<i>evaluate_1D:</i> Given the input control points, this method begins by defining a std::vector&lbVector3D&rb which is used as a buffer to contain intermediate points to interpolate at each level of the de Casterljau algorithm recursion. <br>
  The method then performs a while loop which recurses into <i>evaluate_step</i> using the intermediate control points until the size of the vector returned by the recursion is 1 (at which point we have the evaluated point on the Bezier curve), <br>
  at which point the singular Vector3D containing the evaluated point is returned. <br>
  <br>
  <i>evaluate:</i> This method first creates a std::vector&lbVector3D&rb which it fills with the evaluated points at coordinate u within each of the Bezier curves defined by the rows of the control points by calling <i>evaluate_1D</i>. <br>
  This vector, containing the evaluated u points, is then passed as input as the control point vector to <i>evaluate_1D</i> with the parameter v in order to yield the final evaluated point at coordinate (u,v) on the Bezier surface. <br>
  This point is returned.

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part III: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>

<p>
<b>Implementation:</b><br> For my implementation, I first define a <i>normals</i> vector&lt;Vector3D&gt; and an <i>areas </i>vector&lt;float&gt; for collecting the surface normals and areas, respectively, 
  of all triangle faces in the fan around the given vertex. <br>
  Next, I iterate over all faces around the vertex by starting with the half-edge, <i>h</i>, the vertex points to and updating it as <br>
  <i>h = h-&gt;twin()-&gt;next()</i> in each iteration. 
  For each iteration, I retrive the face associated with the current half-edge, <i>f = h-&gt;face()</i> and <b>check if the face lies on the boundary or not</b>. 
  If the face does not lie within the boundary, then I compute its area and add both its area and normal to the <i>areas</i> and <i>normals</i> vectors. <br><br>

  To compute the area of a given face, I define a helper function, <i>float Face::area</i>, which first collects all 3 of the face's vertices (v0, v1, and v2) in a vector by iterating through
  with the half-edge <i>next()</i> method. Having collected all three vertices, the area is simply half of the area of the trapezoid defined by the vector cross product between 
  the vectors v0-->v1 and v0-->v2, i.e. <br>
  1/2 * |cross(v1 - v0, v2 - v0).norm()|. <br><br>

  Having collected all areas and normals pertaining to the faces in the fan around the vertices, I then compute the weighted normal as follows: 
  First, I loop over and sum all areas into a variable <i>areas_total</i>.
  Next, I define a Vector3D named <i>weighted_normal</i> which will contain the final weighted normal, and set its value as the sum of <i>areas[i] / areas_total * normals[i]</i> by iterating 
  over all areas/normals. <br>
  After performing the weighted sum, <i>weighted_normal</i> is returned. 
</p>

<p>
Below we can see an example of <i>teapot.dae</i> and <i>beetle.dae</i> (which contains boundaries) each with screenshots showing them pre 
and post area-weighted vertex normal shading. 
As may be clearly seen, both are smoother after the shading is turned on.

<h3 align="middle">Part IV: Edge Flip</h2>

<p>
<b>Implementation:</b> In my implementation I first check to see if the given edge is on the boundary, if so I simply return it. 
  If it is not on the boundary, then I first assign all 4 remaining edges across both triangles to variables <i>e1, e2, e3,</i> and <i>e4</i> by traversing half-edges and twins as needed. 
  Similarly, I collect all six half edges associated with the two triangles, as well as the four vertices and two faces. <br><br>
  Next, I continue by assigning pointers to each variable, starting with vertices, then faces, then edges, and finally half-edges.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Symmetries:</b> I noticed a couple of symmetries in assignments. First, each of the half-edges in the flipped edge will have their new next half-edge be the next-next half-edge of its twin. 
  Second, the next-next half edge for each half-edge on the flipped edge will have its face swapped, while the other half-edges will maintain the same face. 
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Results:</b> Below we can see a progression of the teapot mesh before and throughout a number of edge flips.

<p>
  <b>Debugging Journey:</b> During development of the method, I first began by trying to only assign pointers that I thought were necessary (contrary to the suggestion in the project spec!). <br>
  I also found that there were certain symmetries in assignments between half-edges, as noted above, which led me to try implementing a helper method which I would call once per triangle in 
  order to make the code more succinct. 
Unfortunately, yet unsurprisignly, I found that there were certain corner cases in which a hole would be formed in the mesh as a result of the flip operation. <br>
Before diving into debugging tricks, I found that I was able to get the method working by switching strategies and making sure that I was assigning every component pertaining to the two triangles first. <br>
Below I have included an image of a schematic I drew in order to reason about pointer assignments in the data structure. I found that by following the schematic I was able to get a working implementation. <br>
  In the end, I found that a thorough and explicit solution was easier to get correct than to try to express it more elegantly by trying to leverage symmetry in assignments in code refactoring.

<h3 align="middle">Part VI: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling.</h2>

<p>
  <b>Implementation:</b> As a first step I compute the new positions for all original vertices in the mesh using the loop subdivision rule. 
  This is done by iterating over all vertices in the mesh (using <i>mesh.verticesBegin()</i> and <i>mesh.verticesEnd()</i> in a loop. 
  In each iteration of the loop I mark each vertex as not being new by setting <i>isNew</i> to false.
  Following this, I collect all neighboring vertices into a std::vector&lt;VertexIter&gt; in a loop by starting with the vertice's half-edge <i>h</i> and updating it as <i>h = h-&gt;twin()-&gt;next()</i>. 
  I next compute <i>u</i> as 3.0/16.0 if the vertice's degree is 3, otherwise I set if to 3.0 / (8.0 * degree). 
  The new position is then computed as <i>(1.0 - n * u)</i> times the vertice's current position plus the sum of each neighbors position multiplied b <i>u</i> by looping over the neighbors. 
</p>
Next, I computed the updated vertex positions for new vertices that will be created along split edges. This is done by iterating over edges using <i>mesh.edgesBegin()</i> and <i>mesh.edgesEnd()</i>. 
  I then retrieve all vertices pertaining to the two triangles the edge is a part of, assigning them into vertices <i>a, b, c, d</i>. 
  The new position for the new vertex is computed as (3.0/8.0) * (a-&gt;position + b-&gt;position) + (1.0/8.0) * (c-&gt;position + d-&gt;position). 
  <p>
I next split all edges in the original mesh. In order to do this without looping infinitely, I first put all the original edges inside of a vector, which I then iterate over. 
    In each iteration, I split the edge and assign the new vertex resulting from the split into a variable <i>new_v</i>. At this point, I mark that vertex as new (<i>new_v-&gt;isNew = true</i>) and set its new position to the position currently stored in the split edge. <br>
    I then collect all three new edges created by the split by traversing from the new vertices half-edge, and mark the first edge as not new (since it is along the original edge) and the other two are marked as new. 
    <p>
I next flip any edge that connects an old and new vertex. This is done by looping over all edges in the mesh and first checking if they are new. 
      If the edge is new, then I get both verties associated with the edge (using the edge's half-edge and its twin). 
      Next, I check if either the first vertex is old and the second is now or if the first vertex is new and the second old. If either condition is true, then I flip the edge. 
    </p>

  <p>
    At this point, since all of the new positions have already been copied into the <i>newPosition</i> variable of every vertex (both new and old vertices), I simply loop over all of them 
    and copy the new position into the vertice's <i>position</i> variable.
  </p>

<p>
  <b>Debugging:</b> The only problem I ran into during development of the method was an infinite loop that popped up when performing edge splitting. 
  I realized that was caused by the addition of edges into the mesh during splitting, which was causing the loop to never finish. 
  Therefore, in order to fix this I gathered all pre-existing edges into a vector prior to splitting and then iterated over that vector in order to only split
  a finite number of edges. 
</p>  
  
<p>
  <b>Notes on Rounding Effect on Corners and Edges:</b> Because upsampling updates the position of vertices as a weighted average of itself and its neighbors, 
  this essentially has the effect of pulling vertices towards the "center of mass" of its local neighborhoods. 
  Therefore, because corners are always extruding in some direction, the averaging effect will cause them to come closer to the body of the mesh which will result in a rounding effect on them. 
  This effect may be observed in the progression of the torus mesh upsampling below: 
</p>

  <table style="width=100%">

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  <b>Combating Rounding Effect:</b> Due to the averaging effect described above, one way in which we can combat the rounding effect is by pre-modifying the mesh such that the center of mass of a corner's/edge's local neighborhood is 
  closer to its vertices. For example, if we pre-split the edges of the torus such that there is now a new vertex at the center of each of its sides, we will now have a center of mass for each corner's local neighborhood that is closer
  to the corner itself. This allows the torus to better retain its original shape as we can see below, where after upsampling the torus has much mor distinctly flat regions and the original corners may be seen much more clearly 
  (although they are still somewhat rounded).

Notice in the top-left image that the edges of the cube are not symmetric. 
  Take the vertex at the top right of the cube as an example. Of the three sides of the cube that it resides in, 
  we can notice that it is connected to all other vertices on two of the sides, but on one side it is missing a connection 
  to the vertex diagonal from it. 
  This asymmetry in its neighborhood is going to cause its updated position during upsampling to be biased towards the sides it has more connections in, which 
  will result in the observed lopsidedness across the cube. <br><br>

  In contrast, below are images of a cube which has had its edges split such that all vertices are fully connected within each side of of the cube 
  (i.e. every side of the cube has an X formed on it from its edges). All local neighborhoods across vertices are now symmetrical after this 
  preprocessing, which will result in symmetric upsampling as shown below.
